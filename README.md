# Electricity Bill Desktop
An application to calculate electricity bill based on 3 different customer types

## Getting Started
Download/clone the repository on your local machine. There will be various folders within the repository but the following files will be of use to you:
- Electricity_Bill_Desktop\electricityBill\electricityBill.sln

### Prerequisites
At a minimum, Microsoft's free [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) version will be required to run the application in it's original .net framework and view the source code in it's original environment.
Alternatively, you can simply run the application with the .exe file contained in the bin folder.
